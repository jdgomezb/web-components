## Methods

### `closeMe() => Promise<void>`



#### Returns

Developers should try to rely on publicly exposed methods as little as
possible, and instead default to using properties and events as much as
possible. As an app scales, we've found it's easier to manage and pass data
through @Prop rather than public methods.

#### Returns

Type: `Promise<void>`
